Chennai Real Estate Analysis üè†
Project Overview
Welcome to my Chennai Real Estate Analysis project! üìä This dataset dives into the vibrant and dynamic real estate market of Chennai, showcasing details about properties, their features, and sale conditions. Whether you're a data enthusiast or an aspiring data scientist, this project highlights how data-driven insights can reveal trends in urban development and property investments.

About the Dataset
The dataset consists of 7109 entries and 22 features, capturing vital information about properties sold in Chennai, such as:

Property Details: Size (INT_SQFT), type of construction (BUILDTYPE), and age (DATE_BUILD).
Location Information: Areas like Karapakkam, Anna Nagar, Velachery, and more.
Market Features: Sale price (SALES_PRICE), registration fees (REG_FEE), and commission charges.
Quality Scores: Ratings for rooms, bathrooms, and overall quality.
This dataset is perfect for exploring real estate trends, predicting property prices, and analyzing urban development patterns.

Objectives
In this project, I aim to:

Understand Price Trends: Analyze how factors like location, size, and build type influence property prices.
Build Predictive Models: Use regression techniques to estimate property prices based on input features.
Uncover Patterns: Explore relationships between sales conditions, location, and property quality.
Key Insights
Here's what I discovered:

High-Value Areas: Localities like Adyar and Anna Nagar showcase higher average property prices.
Impact of Amenities: Properties with park facilities and paved streets tend to have better sales performance.
Price Determinants: The size of the property (INT_SQFT) and proximity to the main road (DIST_MAINROAD) significantly impact sale prices.
Tools Used
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
Jupyter Notebook: For organizing and documenting the analysis.
Machine Learning: Built predictive models to estimate sales prices.
Future Plans
Extend this analysis by including external data such as population density and infrastructure development.
Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI or Tableau for real-time property market analysis.
